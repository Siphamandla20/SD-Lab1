In this assignment, I initialised a git repository included a ReadMe file on it. 
I created 3 files, the first being a student-info.txt file where I entered my student number as well as my name, the second file being a report.md file (this file) where I wrote a brief report about what I've done on this assignment, and the third file being an index.html file which contained a text saying "Hello world, I am 2659079".
I committed all 3 files and added clear and descriptive messages.
I then added a special commit message on the ReadMe.md file where I wrote the message "feat: Initial commit with student files." 
I then deployed the index.html file to GitHub pages.
