                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Greetings Reader. My name is Siphamandla Mabena and I am a final year 
                bachelor of science student majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.
                I am in my early 20s and I am interested in pursuing a career either in Business 
                Analysis, data analysis, systems analysis, systems development, software 
                development or even IT auditing/consulting. </p>

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>My latest project was an informal personal website which was developed
                    using HTML, CSS and Java. This website was mainly about me and it contained
                    information such as my educational standing, my qualifications, my skills, 
                    as well as any other relevant information. 

                </p>
